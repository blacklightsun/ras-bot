Congratulations!
I am trying to connect the CamJam EduKit 3 to a Raspberry Pico. The motor controller board is not designed to be connected directly to the Raspberry Pico board, so I am connecting GPIO pins 7, 8, 9, 10 on the Raspberry Pico to the corresponding pins of the two-row connector on the motor controller board using a wired connection. It goes without saying that I have connected the motors and the power supply to the motor controller board.

With

the help of a multitester, I checked that the voltage on the connector for the motors' power supply is 5.3-5.5 V.

I also checked that the pin of the two-row connector on the motor controller board, which corresponds to GPIO pins 7, 8, 9, 10, has a voltage of 3.3 V when I set the logic level high for the corresponding GPIO pin (pin8 = Pin(8, Pin.OUT); pin8.on();).

I also checked that the motors rotate when they are connected to the battery (4 AA) directly.

That is, the motor controller board is supplied with power to the motors, control signals from the controller, and the motors are connected.

But when I run the Python script, the motors do not rotate.
What am I doing wrong?

Do I need to make a galvanic isolation by connecting Ground on the Raspberry Pico to Ground on the motor controller board?
Do I need to connect any other pins on the Raspberry Pico and the motor controller board, except for 4 (7, 8, 9, 10)?
Do I need to connect the power pins (3.3v / 5v) on the Raspberry Pico to the motor controller board?

Here's my code for testing:

from machine import Pin
import time

led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)
pin7 = Pin(7, Pin.OUT)
pin8 = Pin(8, Pin.OUT)
pin9 = Pin(9, Pin.OUT)
pin10 = Pin(10, Pin.OUT)

led.on()
pin7.off()
pin8.off()
pin9.off()
pin10. off()
time.sleep(5)
led.off()
time.sleep(5)

led.on() 
pin7.on()
time.sleep(5)
pin8.on()
time.sleep(5)
pin9.on()
time.sleep(5)
pin10.on()
time.sleep(5)
led.off()

led.on()
pin7.off()
pin8.off() 
pin9.off()
pin10.off()
time.sleep(5)
led.off()
time.sleep(5)
